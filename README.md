# Refactoring-Code
Refactoring code is an important part of any developers journey. In this excercise, we refactor a junior developers code and create an interface to extend classes in typescript so they must contain certain pieces of information such as data, or a get function.

The SortUtil class allows us to take in a data piece and send it to the correct classes depending on whether it is a numbered data type, a string, or a Linked List.
